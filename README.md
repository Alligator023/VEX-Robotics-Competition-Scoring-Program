# VEX-Robotics-Competition-Scoring-Program
A Java project deisgned to auto-score VEX Robotics Competition matches from Tipping Point onwards.

Instructions for Installation:

Uploaded is the entire set of Project folders and files for my IntelliJ Idea CE Project in which I developed this. 
What YOU need to do is download the .zip (which will include the unnecessary files), open Eclipse or another editor that doesn't need specific configuration files like Idea does, and copy the packages that you want into your editor. 

The packages that you will want to copy over are the GUI package (necessary no matter what) and the package(s) of whichever game(s) you are wanting to be able to score.
